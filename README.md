GIVEN a website provide informaiton about local birds WHEN the page loads it asks for my location THEN I allow it to know my location WHEN I click to begin THEN I am prompted to give a number of birds to view WHEN when I select more than 25 birds THEN the site limits my selection to 25 WHEN I click "click" THEN I am presented information about birds that are near my location WHEN the bird information loads THEN I am provided the name of the bird, a picture and 3 recordiing of that bird's sounds
